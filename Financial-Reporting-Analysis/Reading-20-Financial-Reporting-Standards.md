## Objective

** **Describe**
* the objective of financial reporting and the importance of financial reporting standards
* the roles of financial reporting standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities in establishing and enforcing reporting standards
* the International Accounting Standards Board’s conceptual framework, including qualitative characteristics of financial reports, constraints on financial reports, and required reporting elements
* general requirements for financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
* implications for financial analysis of alternative financial reporting systems and the importance of monitoring developments in financial reporting standards


### Notes
* standard setting bodies: 
    * FASB -> 
    * IASB -> IFRS
* regulatory authorities bodies:
    * SEC 
    * International Organization of Securities Commissions(IOSCO)

* Reporting elements
    * Qualitative Characteristic
    * Performance 
    * Financial Position
* Constraint
* Underlying assumption
    * Accrual basis: 从交易发生的时刻开始计算  Cash base 根据收钱的时间来进行记录 12月的工资1月发 记在12月就是Accural basis 根据责任和义务的交割转移的时间来记录 记在1月就是Cash base根据拿到钱的时间
    * Going concern: 
*

Measurement of Financial Statement Elements


position:
* Assests
* Liabilities
* Equity

performance:
* Income
* Expenses

Two Assumptions:
* Accrual accounting: reflect transactions in the period when they actually occur, not necessarily when cash movements occur.
* Going concern: the company will continue in business for the foreseeable future. 

Measurement of financial elements:
* Historical cost: amount originally paid for the asset
* Amortized cost: Historical cost adjusted for depreciation, amortization, depletion, and impairment
* Current cost: the amount the firm would have to pay today for the same asset
* Realizable value: amount for which the firm could sell the asset or settlement of obligation
* Present value: The discounted value of the asset's expected future cash flows
* Fair value: The amount at which two knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction would exchange the asset


Faithful representation: complete(all information necessary is depicted) + neutral(without bias) + free from error(no errors of commissions or omission in the description)

IASB conceptual framework:
* Comparability: 可以进行横向比较
* Verifiability: 可以验证
* Timeliness: 及时有效
* Understandability: 简单容易理解

IFRS: Principles-based approach: provide broad framework without specific guideline, requires considerable judgments
US GAAP: Rule-based approach: Sets rules for the record of every single transaction -> objectives-oriented approach: priciples + rule

Q & A:

Realizable value 和 Fair value的区别

inventory 里面用到 carry value 和 net realizable value
carry value = book value 写在表上的数字 
net realizable value = selling price - completion costs and disposal costs
companies using LIFO or the retail method report inventories at the lower of cost or market. 
Q13 Financial performance - income statement 
Q14 Financial position - balance sheet
Q: measurement of financial position / performance?
